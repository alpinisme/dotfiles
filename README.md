# My dotfiles

Eventually, I want to add a bash script to automatically create symlinks (e.g., from `vimrc` to `~/.gvimrc`). For now, this is just a safe place to store things.

Things to do in the script:
- make sure it installs everything necessary and in the right order (e.g., homebrew cask)
- install nvm (then node, via it), elm, 

It might also be worth adding some of the app store apps, like Bear, Wipr, etc.

If I get ambitious, I'll add some os settings
